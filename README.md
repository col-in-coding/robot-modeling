Quadruped Robot Design

## Single Leg Design
For the common gaits like walk and trot, the trajectories of legs are the same way with different phases, so the study can be simplifed. A 3R robot model is build for the study.

### Mathematics
<i>Python</i>

Base on the gait, the simple trajectory route can be designed in taskspace of the end effect.\
Here is the manually design for simple:\
